# Product Review — Latep

Comprehensive review of product design, UI/UX, system architecture, reliability/performance, and intuitiveness/cogency. Based on full codebase analysis (contract, circuit, frontend).

## Product direction — September 2026

The next demo iteration is an interactive world about trust, not a dashboard with more effects.

### Agreed primitives

- Keep accessible HTML controls and the existing typography, spacing, and player-color tokens as the foundation.
- Start with a persistent illustrated stage using SVG and GSAP. Use the same character language for choice, commitment, reveal, and outcome.
- Reserve Three.js for a future spatial diorama if depth and camera movement materially improve the story. WebGL is a rendering API, not a separate product-design strategy. Do not add a second animation engine now.
- Make sound opt-in and event-driven. Navigation and controls stay quiet; game outcomes carry the expressive motion.
- Drive choreography from explicit application states. Animations never establish proof validity, transaction confirmation, or settlement.

### First implementation slice

The home page centers a wallet-free practice round: choose → locally seal → reveal → understand the outcome → play again. Welcome guidance and the personality quiz become optional actions, and Learn, Tournament, and ZK multiplayer remain available below the stage. The local partner cooperates first, then copies the player's previous move. Practice scores use the tutorial's NC_DEFAULT matrix and are labelled as points, not XLM.

This is a simulation: sealing does not generate a cryptographic proof or submit a transaction. The interface must state that plainly. In a later multiplayer integration, proof generation, submission, on-chain verification, reveal, and settlement must remain distinct; never infer success from animation completion or expose a hidden opponent move through appearance or markup.

### Learning integration slice

The home practice round, tutorial sandbox, and the guided Choice and Repeat chapters share a presentational TrustStage. Each caller supplies only the state it is allowed to show: hidden phases do not accept move values, and completed rounds supply the effective moves. The stage does not select strategies, calculate payoffs, generate proofs, or control game progress.

The tutorial keeps its existing immediate local round loop, nine strategies, configurable payoff matrix, noise, history, and session summary. Choices and results sit beside the scene; detailed experiment settings are progressively disclosed. Scores are labelled as practice points. Choice and Repeat retain their lesson rules and achievement hooks; Repeat now records the opponent's own move and the player's move in the correct order for Tit-for-Tat.

The learning integration was extended by the environment and narrative slice below. Tournament population redesign, real multiplayer state integration, and a possible Three.js diorama remain follow-on work.

### Environment and narrative continuity

Trust height is the count of consecutive rounds in which both effective moves cooperate. The stage shows the exact count while capping the decorative terrain displacement at five levels. Reset and non-mutual outcomes return the height to zero. The renderer consumes supplied height; it does not calculate game outcomes.

Configured wind risk is shown separately from observed noise. Only recorded tutorial flip events trigger a gust, with text naming which move changed. The Noise chapter reuses the final round of its existing 50-round simulation; it does not invent additional rounds or infer unrecorded flips.

Intro, Edge, Opponents, Noise, and the multiplayer explainer now use the shared scene vocabulary. The Tournament chapter retains its real population chart within the same surfaces and control style. The final chapter labels its commitment illustration and explains contract escrow without implying a proof or transaction happened on that page.

Shared journey audio starts muted, loads existing assets on opt-in, synchronizes its controls, and stops background music when the journey unmounts. The home practice-round sound toggle remains independently opt-in.

### Follow-on slices

1. Carry the stage and character vocabulary into the tutorial and guided learning journey.
2. Represent repeated cooperation, betrayal, and noise through shared height and wind metaphors without changing game rules.
3. Extend the visual vocabulary to tournament populations while preserving truthful chart scales and accessible data.
4. Integrate the sealed-choice object with real multiplayer states, including rejection, timeout, retry, and settlement.
5. Evaluate a stylized Three.js diorama only after the complete 2.5D interaction has been reviewed.

### Acceptance criteria

A fresh visitor can play without a modal or wallet; all controls work by keyboard and touch; opponent choice is not exposed before reveal; replay cannot race pending timers; reduced motion preserves the full flow; sound starts off; the stage works without WebGL; layouts remain usable at 320, 375, 414, 768, and desktop widths. No contract or proof-service changes are required for this slice.

The historical review below is retained as context; its implementation and deployment claims are not revalidated by this visual-design work.

## 0. Two ZK Patterns Overview

Latep now has **two distinct ZK patterns**, both verified on-chain:

### Pattern 1: Private Accreditation (ZK Allowlist Membership)

**Real-world use case:** KYC/AML compliance, accredited investor verification, compliance-gated access to tokenized assets. Prove you're on an allowlist without revealing which credential is yours.

**What's working:**

- **Poseidon Merkle tree circuit** (`circuits/allowlist_membership/`) — depth-4, 16 leaves, nullifier-based replay protection. Uses `noir-lang/poseidon` with BN254 parameters.
- **Contract functions** — `initialize_accreditation`, `update_accredited_root`, `verify_accreditation`, `is_accreditation_initialized`, `get_accredited_root` — with separate VK storage, root matching, nullifier replay prevention, and event emission.
- **4 contract tests** — real proof verification, wrong root rejection, nullifier replay rejection, uninitialized rejection. All passing.
- **Frontend wiring** — `accreditationProofService.ts` (lazy-loaded Noir + bb.js proof generation), `merkleTree.ts` (pre-computed Poseidon tree data for 3 credentials), `AccreditationPanel.tsx` (admin init + player proof UI).
- **Uses Stellar Protocol 25 Poseidon host functions** — directly leveraging the primitives the hackathon celebrates.

**What's not working:**

- **Demo tree is pre-computed** — 3 credentials with hardcoded Merkle paths. Production system would build tree off-chain and distribute paths privately. This is documented honestly in the README.
- **Nullifiers computed client-side** — via `poseidon-lite` for any game_id (matches `noir-lang/poseidon` BN254 params).

### Pattern 2: Move Commitment Binding

**Real-world use case:** Any commit-reveal scheme where early validation prevents griefing — sealed-bid auctions, fair escrow, wagering.

(See sections 1-5 below for the detailed review of this pattern.)

---

## 1. Product Design

### What's working

**Two ZK patterns, both load-bearing.** The move commitment pattern proves `move ∈ {0,1}` and `keccak256(move || nonce || game_id) == commitment` — removing it breaks fair play. The accreditation pattern proves Merkle tree membership without revealing the leaf — removing it means either storing the full allowlist on-chain (privacy-destroying, gas-expensive) or trusting an off-chain oracle. Both patterns do real work.

**Accreditation maps to real-world Stellar use cases.** The hackathon brief explicitly names "identity and compliance proofs" as a target. Private accreditation — prove you're accredited without revealing which credential is yours — is directly applicable to KYC/AML, accredited investor verification, and compliance-gated settlement. This is the strongest card for judging.

**Game theory model is sound.** The payoff matrix (CC=2×, CD=0/3×, DC=3×/0, DD=0) is the standard Prisoner's Dilemma. Escrow-then-reveal with timeout forfeit is the right structural design for on-chain games.

**Trust model is cleanly separated.** The circuit proves commitment validity; the contract proves game mechanics (auth, state, timing, payouts); the frontend proves proper randomness. Each layer does what it's good at.

### What's not working

**~~Single-player mode is broken.~~** ✅ **Fixed.** The broken single-player contract stub has been removed. The tutorial now uses a local simulation (no wallet/contract needed) with the same strategy classes. The tutorial mode label has been updated to "Tutorial (vs AI)" to set correct expectations.

**No game discovery mechanism.** Players can only see games in the lobby by polling `get_game_count` and iterating. Contract events are now emitted (`GameCreated`, `GameJoined`, etc.) enabling future off-chain indexing, but no event subscription or filter for open games is built yet. For a hackathon demo, you need two browsers side-by-side. For real use, you'd need a relay/matchmaking layer.

**~~No iterated games.~~** ✅ **Fixed (tutorial + on-chain).** The tutorial supports iterated play with 9 stateful strategies that remember past rounds. The ZK multiplayer contract now supports multi-round matches (best-of-3/5) with rematch support, closing the gap between tutorial and multiplayer.

**~~No tournament system.~~** ✅ **Fixed.** Full evolutionary tournament mode is built — all 9 strategies compete in round-robin, weak are eliminated, strong reproduce. Population bar chart, auto-play, noise slider, payoff matrix editor, and population-over-generations chart are all functional.

**Reputation proofs not built.** The original plan's most novel ZK feature (proving cooperation rate without revealing individual moves) was not implemented. This was the feature that would have distinguished this from a standard commit-reveal scheme.

### Recommendations

1. ~~**Hide or remove the single-player entry point**~~ ✅ Done — replaced with local simulation
2. ~~**Add a "copy game link" button** in the lobby~~ ✅ Done — copy game link functionality added
3. **Be honest in the demo** about what's built vs. planned — the ZK commit-reveal is real and load-bearing; reputation proofs are future work

---

## 2. UI/UX

### What's working

**Commit flow has good feedback states.** The "choose → generating → submitting" progression with spinner + status text + debug info gives users clear visibility into what's happening during the slowest part of the flow (proof generation).

**Nonce display is prominent.** The yellow "Save Your Nonce!" box with monospace text is hard to miss. The sessionStorage auto-fill on reveal is a good UX touch.

**Payoff matrix is always visible** during move selection, which helps users understand the game theory.

**Move selection buttons are visually distinct** — green Cooperate vs. red Defect with emoji icons.

**Latep thematic UI is distinctive.** The trust fall metaphor runs through the entire experience — "the fall" during commitment, "the catch or the impact" as the result. Trust altitude visual grows with consecutive mutual cooperation. CSS animations (fall, sway, catch, impact, shake, glow) create a cohesive visual language.

**Iterated tutorial is rich.** 9 stateful strategies with distinct personalities, move history table, trust altitude, noise slider, payoff matrix editor, and strategy inspector — all in the tutorial mode. This matches the depth of Nicky Case's original.

**Tournament mode is compelling.** Population bar chart, auto-play, evolution over generations, winner detection — watching which strategies survive is genuinely educational. The noise and payoff matrix sliders let you run experiments ("what if temptation is 10x?").

**Strategy inspector is educational.** Click "Inspect [strategy name]" to see how it thinks — plain-English decision logic, first move, strengths, weaknesses, and a concrete round-by-round example. This bridges the gap between "I'm playing an AI" and "I understand this AI."

### What's not working

**~~Reveal phase requires re-selecting your move.~~** ✅ **Fixed.** The reveal phase now auto-fills the committed move from localStorage and provides helper text for confirmation.

**~~No mobile responsiveness.~~** ✅ **Fixed.** Responsive breakpoints added at `max-width: 640px` — 2-column grids collapse to single column, move buttons stack vertically, padding reduced.

**Debug info shown to end users.** The commitment hash prefix and proof hex prefix are displayed in the status box. Non-technical users won't understand these. Should be behind a toggle or removed in production.

**Silent wallet disconnect.** If the wallet disconnects during a game (polling detects it), the app silently returns to "Connect Your Wallet" with no explanation. Users may think the app crashed.

**~~No visual polling indicator.~~** ✅ **Fixed.** Lobby now shows a pulsing waiting indicator when waiting for an opponent, and a visual notification when the opponent joins.

**~~Reveal deadline UX is unclear.~~** ✅ **Partially fixed.** Cancel and refund buttons now appear when deadlines pass, with countdown timers showing time remaining. Claim forfeit is still not surfaced as a button.

### Recommendations

1. ~~**Auto-fill move in reveal phase**~~ ✅ Done
2. ~~**Add responsive breakpoints**~~ ✅ Done
3. **Hide debug info behind a toggle** — "Show technical details" checkbox
4. **Add toast notification on wallet disconnect** — "Wallet disconnected. Reconnect to continue."
5. **Add "Last updated: 12:34:05" timestamp** in the game view polling area
6. ~~**Show actionable buttons after deadline**~~ ✅ Done for cancel/refund; claim forfeit button still needed

---

## 3. System Architecture

### What's working

**Contract function design is clean.** `create_game → join_game → reveal_move → resolve_game` (or `claim_forfeit`) is a clear state machine. Each function has proper auth, state validation, and error handling.

**Proof verification is correctly separated.** The `verify_proof` helper handles serialization and verifier setup; `verify_reveal` handles hash verification. These are distinct cryptographic operations with different trust assumptions.

**Public input serialization is consistent.** The 96-byte blob (3 × 32-byte Field elements) is constructed identically in the contract, circuit, and frontend. Big-endian encoding, zero-padding, and commitment split (high/low) all match.

**Keccak256 preimage is identical across all three components.** `move_byte (1) || nonce (8 BE) || game_id (8 BE)` = 17 bytes. Verified in circuit (`main.nr`), frontend (`noirProofService.ts`), and contract (`lib.rs`).

**Version pinning is correct.** `@noir-lang/noir_js@1.0.0-beta.9` matches `nargo 1.0.0-beta.9`; `@aztec/bb.js@0.87.0` matches `bb v0.87.0`. Proof flavor (`{ keccak: true }`) matches the on-chain verifier.

### What's not working

**~~CRITICAL: Self-join vulnerability.~~** ✅ **Fixed.** `join_game()` now checks `if player2 == game.player1 { return Err(Error::Unauthorized) }`. Test `test_self_join_prevented` verifies this.

**~~Stuck games with locked funds.~~** ✅ **Fixed.** Two recovery functions added:

- `cancel_game`: player1 reclaims stake if no opponent joins before commit deadline
- `claim_refund`: anyone can trigger split refund if both players timeout on reveal

**~~Wrong error in `claim_forfeit`.~~** ✅ **Fixed.** Now returns `GameNotReady` instead of `MoveAlreadyRevealed`.

**~~Game ID race condition.~~** ✅ **Fixed.** Frontend auto-retries up to 2 times if `create_game` fails with a proof/commitment mismatch, re-fetching the game count each time.

**~~No event emission.~~** ✅ **Fixed.** Contract now emits `GameCreated`, `GameJoined`, `MoveRevealed`, `GameResolved`, `GameForfeited`, `GameCancelled` events.

### Recommendations

1. ~~**Fix self-join vulnerability immediately**~~ ✅ Done
2. ~~**Add `cancel_game` function**~~ ✅ Done
3. ~~**Add `claim_double_forfeit` function**~~ ✅ Done (as `claim_refund`)
4. ~~**Fix the error message** in `claim_forfeit`~~ ✅ Done
5. ~~**Add auto-retry for game_id race**~~ ✅ Done
6. ~~**Consider events**~~ ✅ Done

## 4. Reliability & Performance

### What's working

**Proof generation is the critical path and it works.** bb.js generates a 14,592-byte proof that verifies against the on-chain Rust verifier. This was cross-verified (bb.js proof → Rust verifier test).

**Contract tests are comprehensive.** 19/19 tests pass: 7 single-round tests (real proof verification, fake proof rejection, wrong-length rejection, zero-stake rejection, payout calculation, cancel after deadline, refund on both timeout, self-join prevention) + 8 multi-round match tests (create match, invalid best-of, full best-of-3, completed after two wins, cancel after timeout, forfeit awards round) + 4 accreditation tests (real proof verification, wrong root rejection, nullifier replay rejection, uninitialized rejection).

**Error handling is consistent.** All contract functions use `Result<T, Error>` with the `?` operator. All frontend hook functions use try-catch-finally with `isLoading` and `error` state.

### What's not working

**Proof generation latency is unknown in-browser.** The Rust test verifies the proof, but browser WASM performance varies. The UI shows "Generating ZK proof..." but there's no timeout or progress indicator. If bb.js WASM fails to load (e.g., worker path issues), the app hangs silently.

**No proof generation timeout.** If bb.js hangs (WASM init failure, browser incompatibility), the user is stuck on "Generating ZK proof..." forever. No timeout, no error, no fallback.

**~~Bundle size is large.~~** ✅ **Fixed.** bb.js and noir_js are now lazy-loaded via dynamic `import()`. The initial page load bundle is ~200KB; the ~10MB WASM only downloads when the user first triggers proof generation.

**Polling is inefficient.** The frontend polls `get_game` every 5 seconds for each active game. With N games, that's N requests every 5 seconds. No batching, no websocket, no event subscription.

**~~Nonce stored in sessionStorage only.~~** ✅ **Fixed.** Nonce is now stored in localStorage first (with sessionStorage fallback), surviving browser close.

### Recommendations

1. **Add proof generation timeout** — 30-second timeout with error message "Proof generation timed out. Please try again."
2. ~~**Lazy-load bb.js**~~ ✅ Done — dynamically imported on first proof generation
3. **Show WASM download progress** — "Loading ZK engine... (4.2MB)" during first proof generation
4. ~~**Store nonce in localStorage with game_id key**~~ ✅ Done
5. **Batch game polling** — fetch all active games in one request (add `get_games_by_player` contract function)
6. **Add a "I lost my nonce" recovery path** — explain that funds will be forfeited, provide a "Claim Forfeit for opponent" button if applicable

---

## 5. Intuitiveness & Cogency

### What's working

**The ZK explanation in the README is honest and clear.** "Without the proof, a player could commit to an arbitrary hash and grief the opponent" is the right framing. The "Why ZK?" section directly answers the judge's first question.

**The demo script is well-structured.** It walks through the two-player flow, emphasizes that ZK is load-bearing, and highlights the on-chain verification. The "Key Points to Emphasize" section is good for staying on message.

**The payoff matrix is always visible** during move selection, which grounds the game theory in something tangible.

### What's not working

**~~The app doesn't explain itself to a new user.~~** ✅ **Fixed.** A 3-step onboarding overlay (`OnboardingOverlay.tsx`) now appears on first visit to `/play`, explaining: (1) Choose your move, (2) Zero-Knowledge proof generation, (3) Commit then reveal. Dismissed state persisted in localStorage.

**The "Generating ZK proof..." step is a black box.** Users don't know what's happening, how long it will take, or what a ZK proof is. A one-line explanation like "Creating a zero-knowledge proof that your move is valid (this takes a few seconds)" would help.

**~~The reveal phase doesn't explain why re-selection is needed.~~** ✅ **Fixed.** The reveal phase now auto-fills the committed move and provides helper text explaining the confirmation.

**The nonce presentation is scary.** "Save Your Nonce! You'll need this to reveal your move" with a big number in monospace is intimidating. Users don't know what a nonce is or why they need to save it. Better: "Your secret code (saved automatically in your browser) — write this down as backup."

**~~No connection between the tutorial and the game.~~** ✅ **Fixed.** The tutorial has three game modes (Tutorial, Tournament, Multiplayer) accessible from the same screen, creating a natural progression: learn → experiment → play for real. The strategy inspector helps users understand AI behavior before facing real opponents. Multi-round matches in ZK multiplayer now mirror the iterated play taught in the tutorial.

### Recommendations

1. ~~**Add a 3-step onboarding overlay**~~ ✅ Done
2. **Add helper text during proof generation** — "Creating a zero-knowledge proof that your move is valid. This takes a few seconds."
3. **Reframe the nonce** — "Your secret code" with "Saved automatically — write it down as backup in case you close your browser"
4. **Connect the tutorial to the game** — add a final slide that says "Ready to play for real? Click here to start a ZK game" linking to `/play`
5. **Add a "How it works" expandable section** in the lobby — 3 sentences about commit-reveal + ZK, with a link to the README for details
